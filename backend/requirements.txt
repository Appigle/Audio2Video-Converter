# Note: faster-whisper is NOT included here because it has dependency conflicts
# with Python 3.14+ (requires onnxruntime which isn't available for Python 3.14).
# Install it separately using the install script or manual steps below.

# For Python 3.14+ users, install faster-whisper manually:
# pip install faster-whisper --no-deps
# pip install ctranslate2 huggingface-hub tokenizers

# For Python 3.11/3.12 users, you can try:
# pip install faster-whisper>=1.2.1
